* SQL/PHP based query application that leverages a database stored on Oracle servers
to query, insert, and update data belonging to users. 

* The domain of our application is a stadium booking system. We focused on the
data involved in customers making transactions for stadium venues and their related
events.
* Our application has information on two types of customers who can make
transactions related to stadium venues. The first is customers booking an entire
venue to host an event. The second type of available transaction
for customers is to buy tickets for a seat/ section to an event. Specific
information on age group and VIP status would influence the price of the tickets. Our system
also specific information on the events for a venue. This includes
information on performers as well as the category of the event, e.g., sports,
concerts, or theatre.
* This system allows users to execute relevant queries that help in understanding the state of a
potential stadium booking application.
